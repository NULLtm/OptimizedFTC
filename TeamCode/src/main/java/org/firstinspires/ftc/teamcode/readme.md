## Hello Good Programmers!

This is the OptimizedFTC Quickstart Project!

Here are some features it adds to the traditional SDK:

- onRelease, onPress functionality for gamepads
- Controllers -- the virtual form of gamepads (you can have more than 2!)
- Controls -- The dynamic form of Keys, you can have names to represent keys ("intake" = Key.A)
- SynchronousDelayGates -- Delay teleop code without locking up the thread (OPEN, CLOSE, and COMPLETE)
- EasyOpenCV Builder -- Automatically manages vision resources, outlines submats, labels them, all packaged into one!
- Hardware Aliases -- Ever wanted to have two names associated with your hardware component? Well now you can!
- Robot Auto Drive Functions -- A bunch of simple alogrithms for SIMPLE autos: ex. linear drive, strafe, runToPos, etc.
- Robot Teleop Functions -- Does the tedious work for you: algorithms for intake motor controls, servo toggling, etc.
- Disable Keys on gamepads -- Don't want to accidentally have the robot move while initializing a controller? Use this!
- Packaged grabbing of hardware -- Don't want to write out all of your motor settings for each one? OptimizedRobot has you covered!
- Advanced DriveTrain algorithm -- Multiple controllers driving? Have forward in any direction? Override key for controllers? Slow and precision modes? We have you!
